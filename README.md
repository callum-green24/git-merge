Complete a merge that requires conflicts to be resolved and briefly (in just a sentence or two) explain how the conflict arose and how you resolved it. Provide a link to the commit.

For this I created my own git repository locally using git init and created my own conflict with txt files commiting different txt in the main and branch. After I had created the conflict and failed the merge, I used the cat cmd in terminal and to resolve just removed the txt block and head tag.
